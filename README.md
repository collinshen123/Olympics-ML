# Olympics-ML Project


I developed an ML project leveraging historical Olympic data to forecast a country's future medal count through a Linear Regression model. This project employed essential libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to analyze past trends and make predictions based on data-driven insights.
